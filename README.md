# mesh-policy

This repo will contain examples for applying [mesh][] to a few tax policy modeling projects. My goal for this project is to tie together some projects that I am familiar with in order to hone in the mesh API. Hopefully, the ecosystem of connected models developed here will become useful in its own right as the mesh and mesh-policy projects mature.
